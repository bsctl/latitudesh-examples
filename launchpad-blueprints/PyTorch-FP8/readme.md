# PyTorch + FP8 NGC

The FP8 image from NVIDIA is a powerful tool for deep learning practitioners looking to leverage the latest advancements in low-precision computing. By providing an optimized environment for FP8 operations, this image allows for more efficient training and inference of deep learning models on Ada (e.g. L40S) and Hopper (e.g. H100) NVIDIA GPUs.
